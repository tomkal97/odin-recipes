<h3>Delicious Vegan Lasagna made with a Tofu riccotta. A healthy and nutritous 
    option for those with dairy sensitivites or exclusion diets.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>12 Lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 TBSP of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 chopped zucchini</li>
    <li>8 oz of sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>48 oz of homemade marinara</li>
</ul>
<h2>For the Tofu Ricotta</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 14 oz package of extra firm tofu, drained and pressed</li>
    <li>10 oz of home made hummus</li>
    <li>1 tsp fine sea salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp of garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation and cooking instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and press the tofu </li>
    <li>If using no-boil noodles, proceed to step 3. If using 
        noodles that need to be cooked, bring a large pot of salted water
         to a boil. (A splash of olive oil helps prevent the noodles from 
         sticking together!) Add noodles and cook just until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>While the noodles boil, cook the veggies. Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Once hot, add zucchini and mushrooms plus a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until softened. Add spinach and sauté for another 3-5 minutes. Remove pan from heat.</li>
    <li>Crumble pressed tofu into a medium mixing bowl. Add hummus, nutritional yeast, salt, garlic powder, and basil if using. Use your hands to combine until it resembles creamy ricotta.</li>
    <li>Add 1 heaping cup of marinara to the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish, spreading it evenly. Top with about 4 noodles (3 lengthwise and 1 widthwise to cover the gap at the end, depending on the size).</li>
    <li>Top evenly with half of the ricotta mixture and half of the vegetable mixture. Top with 1 ½ cups or more of sauce. Repeat with another layer of noodles, the rest of the tofu mixture, and remaining veggies.</li>
    <li>Top with one last layer of noodles and another 1 ½ cups or more of sauce. Top with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.</li>
    <li>Cover dish with foil and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until noodles are softened. Oven times may vary depending on the noodles used. Let lasagna rest for 15 minutes before eating! Lasagna will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
