    <li>1 tsp. lemon juice</li>

<h2>Cookies: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups blanched almond flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup coconut oil, melted</li>
    <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
    <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 350F and lightly grease a cookie sheet.</li> 
    <li>Combine the almond flour, melted coconut oil, honey, vanilla, lemon juice, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt. Stir well until a thick cookie dough forms.</li> 
    <li>With your hands, form the dough into a large ball. Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. </li>
    <li>While the dough is in the refrigerator, combine the blueberries, honey, lemon juice, and sea salt in a microwave-safe bowl.</li>

    <li>With a cookie scooper, scoop out the chilled cookie dough on to the baking sheet. Lightly press your thumb into the center of each ball of cookie dough.</li> 
    <li>Fill each “thumbprint” with about a teaspoon of the homemade blueberry jam. </li>
    <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, until edges are slightly golden-brown.</li>
